        <p> Hi, I’m Bidhan — a Computer Science major at Weber State University, originally from Nepal. I’m passionate about technology and always curious to learn new things in the world of computing. Outside of academics, I love backpacking, going on hikes, and riding bikes, which keep me grounded and adventurous. Beyond code, I dream of becoming a pilot and I also enjoy photography, videography, and community projects — always looking for ways to connect tech with real-world impact. </p>
